# codit
Scripted Process/File Hacker

Will be scripted in Lua for speed and convenience,
this allows for customisable trainers/cheat software.
An example would be something made specifically for
emaultors like PCSX2 or ePSXe, the only thing that would
be OS specific would configuration and the codit build,
the script would remain the same.
